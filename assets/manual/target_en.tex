\section{ Why stock bb-Fibu?}

 If one reads relevant books concerning bookkeeping, one cannot get
the impression that the accompanying bookkeeping rules, which are
partly legally embodied are more complicated, than it the subject requires.

 The numerous EDP programmes present at the market carry this ballast with
itself around, and are therefore accordingly complex.

  In order to realize quite easily the above relations in a just as simple
and undemanding program, this new development became necessary (it is e.g.
possible to correct already inserted  journal-entries, further the journal is
sorted automaticly in respect to the date).  From this a  clearer
bookkeeping that is always settled results.

 Efforts were made to write the program in such a way that it can be
easily be portet on different EDP platforms and that it is directly executable
under any operating system.



\subsection{ Target group for stock bb-Fibu:}
